In this lab, I implemented a banking system using Java that includes the following components:

BankAccount: An abstract class defining the core functionalities of a bank account, such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance management.
CheckingAccount: A subclass that adds a check clearing fee to withdrawals and manages checking accounts.
SavingsAccount: A subclass that incorporates an annual interest rate, allows for multiple savings accounts under the same account number, and includes a method for posting monthly interest.
This implementation demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and method overriding. The functionality has been tested using the provided AccountDriver class, confirming that all features operate as expected.
